        <p>
          As an avid traveller I have always been interested in different
          cultures, languages, and perspectives and am a firm believer that the
          world needs to get closer together. I never knew what path I wanted to
          take to further enhance globalization but while I was living in China
          before the pandemic I realized that tech was the way to go. I love the
          idea of technology bridging the gap between nations and I cannot wait
          to begin my tech journey and see what paths open up along the way!
